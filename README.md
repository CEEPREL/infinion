## Tech Stack

- React (CRA - Create React App)
- Redux Toolkit – global state management
- TypeScript – type safety
- react-window – virtualized user grid
- react-router-dom – routing
- Tailwind CSS – modern styling
- React Skeletons – loading feedback
- Custom Search Algorithm – user lookup by name/email
- Reusable Modal System – for user details

## Features

### User Listing

- Virtualized grid using `react-window` to handle large user lists efficiently
- Skeleton UI during loading
- Responsive columns:

### Intelligent Search

- Live search input with dropdown
- Select from results to open user detail
- Search helper in `utils/user-search.ts`

### Retry Logic

- If API fails to respond within 10 seconds, a retry button appears
- Built with `utils/retry.ts` for reusable retry pattern

### Modal View

- Click user to fetch full details
- Modal opened via Redux-managed component slot

### Sidebar Navigation

- Responsive sidebar with icons
- Hamburger menu on mobile
- Highlights current route
- Integrates with `react-router-dom`

## Running Locally

1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ceeprel/infinion.git
cd infinion
```

2. Install dependencies

```bash
yarn install
```

3. Run the app

```bash
yarn start
```

## Notes

- You must configure your Redux API slice to fetch users from your backend or mock server.
- The app uses a modal system that takes React nodes. It’s simple, flexible, and doesn’t rely on external libraries.
- Uses `react-window` for list/grid virtualization (fast rendering of 1000+ items).

## Nice to have Feature

- Pagination support for non-virtualized lists
- Dark mode persistence with system preference
- notifications
- Authentication
- Authentication and role-based views
- Unit and integration tests with Jest/Testing Library
